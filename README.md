# Automatic Gazebo Terrain Model Generator

## Summary

This repository contains a simple python-based program that can generate a Gazebo terrain model from a greyscale PNG image input. The program creates the necessary files for the model based on user input, while also resizing and reformating the given heightmap image to ensure compatability with Gazebo. (Based on this [tutorial](https://github.com/AS4SR/general_info/wiki/Creating-Heightmaps-for-Gazebo)).

## WARNING

Currently a working on updating the program with some new features and to work with newer versions of ROS/Gazebo; Until then the program is not really functional. The previous release (v1.0) is known to work with ROS Kinetic/Gazebo 7.9.
